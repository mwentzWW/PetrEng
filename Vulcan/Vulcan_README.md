# Project Vulcan
This tool is meant to read in wellbore values for azimuth, inclination angle, and measured depth to calculate the wellbore tragectory. The wellpath will then be plotted in 3D space. Future add-on will take an input target zone (sphere or box) with the tolerance and create the optimal wellbore drilling path.
